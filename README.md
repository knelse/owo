This mod replaces most of game text with the objectively better version of it. 
Should work with any locale that uses Latin alphabet, but tested only in English.

Some UI elements are very stubborn and might still stay the same.

Code heavily inspired by FF14 Dalamud mod by goat (https://github.com/goaaats/dalamud-owo/blob/master/owo/OwoPlugin.cs)
